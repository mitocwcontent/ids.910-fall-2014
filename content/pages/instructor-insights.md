Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _IDS.910 Leadership Development_ as it was taught by Professor Dava Newman in Fall 2014.

This course is a required experience for first-year students in the [Technology and Policy Program](http://tppserver.mit.edu/) (TTP). It is designed to help students develop their leadership capabilities. An initial Outward Bound experience builds trust, teamwork and communication skills. Classes are held in a seminar environment and readings and assignments emphasize the characteristics of desired leadership skills. Global leaders participate in the “Leadership Lunch” story-telling series to share experiences and to provide recommendations. Discussions help explore and further probe leadership development. The learning experience culminates in a personal leadership plan.

This is a partial term course and meets on an irregular schedule during the first 11 weeks of the 15-week semester.
